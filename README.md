Once upon a time retail manager who switched to exploring code in summer 2016 with **Makers Academy**. Always excited by the internals of how something works (from the natural world to the digital) and the role creativity plays in a solution finding process. <br>As I am also fascinated by the intersection of art, technology and humanity in the modern world I decided to explore one of my curiousities further and was inticed by the perpetual opportunity to learn.

## **Skills**

#### _Software Development_

* Test driven code using _Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, Mocha_ and headless browsers such as _ZombieJS_ and _Selenium_.
* Experience using SQL databases through ORMs such as _datamapper_ and _activerecord_. Also experience using non-relational database systems (_MongoDB_).
* Agile practices such as doing daily stand-ups, retros and delivering MVPs with an incremental approach to feature addition.
* Writing fullstack MVC apps with RESTful routing using _RoR, Sinatra_ and _Express_.
* Understanding of and ability to apply in practice key design considerations such as Single Responsibility, Dependancy Injection and encapsulation.
* Good knowldege of HTML and CSS with an appreciation for the importance of writing semantic markup.
* Driven to write clean and maintainable code.

#### _Communication_

* Patient and calm team player always willing to empathise and see a situation from different perspectives. I have nurtured a flexible communication model from 360 and stop/start/continue feedback in previous roles.
* My previous employment has allowed me to develop effective communication with a broad demographic in at times highly demanding and fast paced environments. My core learning was that mutual success is built on reflective and pre-emptive communication styles rather than reactive.
* I have attended more than one course on communication using the 'Colours' framework. While I did not identify with the way it seeks to startify peoples' character I do resonate with its underlying tennant, "speak with people in a voice _they_ can listen to".

####Â _Management_

*  9 years in retail management that required a strong work ethic and organisational skills. Ensuring marketing events were landed on time and to a high standard with availible resources.
* I worked in three stores and all had an improvement in KPIs during my time at them. These improvements covered team engagement and loss control with themes such as improving feedback and more effective scheduling.
* I enjoyed my time in retail and was priveleged to have worked with some incredible people, but eventually felt I was no longer being stretched by the challenges it presented.

## **Recent Projects**

A couple of recent projects I really enjoyed working on.

#### [Volunteer Matcher](https://github.com/benjamin-white/volunteer-matcher)&#8599;
A group project completed while attending Makers Academy for connecting charitable projects needing support with resources. We chose to push ourselves and completed this project entirely in Javascript using node and MongoDB which I loved working with.

#### [Blank Canvas](https://github.com/benjamin-white/blank_canvas)&#8599;
My final week project at Makers completed with four other students. We used Rails to quickly deliver a site that allowed users to paint rooms with a custom palette generated from an uploaded photo. This presented some unexpected learning curves and the chance to use SVGs with Javascript for interactivity which was a lot of fun to do!


## **Education**

#### _Makers Academy | June - September 2016_

* A fast paced and intensive full-time spring board course in software development.
* I completed the course remotely and while working part-time at weekends. This was very demanding but a worthwhile and rewarding experience.

#### _Canterbury Christ Church | 2002 - 2004_

* HND in Multimedia
* Exploring the role and impact of digital technologies in motion and interactive design.

## **About Me**

In my spare time I enjoy reading science, philosophy and of course programming books. I have occasionally dipped my toes into freelance illustration, which for the curious can be seen on the site <a href="http://workbyben.com">workbyben</a>&#8599;. My favourite place to visit is Iceland for its beautiful landscapes (and I like that Nordic minimalism thing!).
